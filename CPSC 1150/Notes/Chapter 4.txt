4.2
	Math Class - Contains many useful methods for performing common mathematical functions.
	Method - Group of statements that perform a specific task
	Trigonometric Methods - Included in the Math class
		METHOD:			DESCRIPTION:
		sin(radians)		Returns the trigonometric sine of an angle in radians
		cos(radians)		Returns the trigonometric cosine of an angle in radians
		tan(radians)		Returns the trigonometric tangent of an angle in radians
		toRadians(degree)	Returns the angle in radians for the angle in degrees
		toDegrees(radians)	Returns the angle in degrees for the angle in radians
		asin(a)			Returns the angle in radians for the inverse of sine
		acos(a)			Returns the angle in radians for the inverse of cosine
		atan(a)			Returns the angle in radians for the inverse of tangent
	Exponent Methods - Included in the Math class
		METHOD:			DESCRIPTION:
		exp(x) 			Returns e raised to power of x (ex)
		log(x) 			Returns the natural logarithm of x (ln(x) = loge(x))
		log10(x) 			Returns the base 10 logarithm of x (log10(x))
		pow(a, b) 			Returns a raised to the power of b (ab)
		sqrt(x) 			Returns the square root of x (2x) for x 7 = 0
	Rounding Methods - Included in the Math class
		METHOD:			DESCRIPTION:
		ceil(x) 			x is rounded up to its nearest integer; returned as a double value
		floor(x) 			x is rounded down to its nearest integer; returned as a double value
		rint(x) 			x is rounded to its nearest integer; if x is equally close to two integers, the even one is returned as a double value
		round(x) 			Returns (int)Math.floor(x + 0.5) if x is a float and returns (long)Math.floor(x + 0.5) if x is a double
	Min Method - Returns the minimum of two numbers (int, long, float, or double)
	Max Method - Returns the maximum of two numbers (int, long, float, or double)
	Abs Method - Returns the absolute value of a number (int, long, float, or double)
