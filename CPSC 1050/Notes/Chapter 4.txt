	Voltage Level:
		~ Low Voltage: Has a range of 0 to 2 volts, and is interpreted as a binary 0
		~ High Voltage: Has a range of 2 to 5 volts, and is interpreted as a binary 1
	Gate - A device that performs a basic operation on electrical signals
		~ Accepts one or more input signals and produces one output signal
		~ There are six fundamental types of gates:
			-> NOT
			-> AND
			-> OR
			-> XOR
			-> NAND
			-> NOR
	Circuits - Multiple types of gates combined together to perform more complicated tasks
	Three notational methods are used to describe the behavior of gates and circuits:
		~ Boolean expression (aka Boolean Algebra)
			-> Mathematical notation for expressing two-valued logical functions
		~ Logic diagram
			-> Graphical representation of a circuit
		~ Truth table
			-> Defines the function of a gate by listing all possible input combinations that the gate could encounter,  along with corresponding output
4.2
	NOT Gate:
		~ Accepts one input value and produces one output value
		~ In Boolean expressions, represented by an apostrophe after negating a value
		~ Will output the opposite value of the input
		~ Sometimes referred to as an inverter
		~ Logic diagram symbol is a triangle with a small circle (known as an inversion bubble) on the end
	AND Gate:
		~ Accepts two input signals
		~ If both signals have a value of 1, the output will be 1; otherwise, the output will be 0
		~ Expressed using a single dot (Â·) in Boolean algebra
		~ The total input combination is the input values squared, while the number of outputs that equal 1 is equal to the number of input 
		~ Logic diagram symbol is semi-pill shaped
	OR Gate:
		~ Accepts two input signals
		~ If both signals have a value of 0, the output will be 0; otherwise, the output will be 1
		~ In Boolean algebra, expressed using a plus sign (+)
		~ The total input combination is the input values squared, while the number of outputs that equal 0 is always 1
	XOR Gate:
		~ Means "Exclusive OR"
		~ Functions mostly the same as the OR Gate; however, if all values match as 1 or 0, the output will be 0.
