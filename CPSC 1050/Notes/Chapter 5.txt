	Ghz - Also known as a gigahertz; 1,000,000,000 hertz
	Mhz - Also known as a megahertz; 1,000,000 hertz
	FSB - Also known as a front-side bus; controls the connection between the processor and then outside world
	MB - Also known as a megabyte; 1,000,000 bytes
	Cache - Small, fast memory usually built into a processor
	Tradeoffs for a Faster Computer:
		~ Higher speed will consume more power, which may cause circuits to overheat and shut down
		~ Faster FSB requires faster devices in the outside world, which means circuitry is more expensive
		~ If cache gets bigger, than the data it holds will become slower, which slows down the processor
	LED - Light-emitting diode
		~ Advantages include:
			-> Lasts longer
			-> Does not contain mercury
	GPU - Graphics processing unit
		~ Can be more powerful than the main processor
		~ Software often send their commands to the GPU because it can process image signals and display them very quickly
		~ Has its own memory
	RAM - Random access memory
		~ Also known as main memory
		~ SDRAM stands for synchronous, dynamic random access memory
		~ Shared memory means that the memory can be accessed by both the central processing unit and the graphics processing unit
		~ DDR - Also known as double data rate; used to express the type of RAM
	HDD - Hard Disk Drive
		~ Often used as the main or secondary storage unit of a computer system
		~ Contains a rotating disk, which is used to access and write data
		~ Speed is measured in RPM, or revolutions per minute
			-> Disks are often found in 5,400 RPM and 7,200 RPM, though there are 15,000 variants available as well
	SSD - Solid State Drive
		~ Gradually replacing HDDs
		~ Technology inside is similar to RAM, except the data stored inside it is not wiped when the system is powered off
		~ Does not contain moving parts, reads and writes faster as a result
	DVD - Digital Video Disc
		~ DVD R indicates the drive can record on special DVDs that can be written to
			-> DVD -R and +R are two different standards
			-> Can only be written to once
		~ DVD RW indicates the drive can be rewritten
	802.11 - Number of a standard that has been defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for networking
		~ Four versions of the standard as of textbook's writing
			-> 802.11a: Original standard
			-> 802.11b: A variant of 802.11a
			-> 802.11g: Supported communication over a longer distance at the expense of slightly slower speed
			-> 802.11n: Has both greater distance and speed
	Bluetooth - Another form of wireless network
		~ Operates at a much shorter range and has a relatively weak signal
		~ Typically used to connect wireless peripherals
	Laptop Batteries - Use a special type of technology based on Lithium, as normal rechargeable batteries cannot output the same amount of power
